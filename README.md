# Embedded systems

This repository contains the examples created in the Embedded systems practices. Each folder includes a project with the neccessary code written in the Espressif IDE, tested on the ESP32-C6-DevKitM-1.

### Required steps before testing examples:

1. Install the Espressif IDE:
[Click here](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/espressif-ide/en/latest/downloads.html#downloads)

2. Install the ESP-IDF: 
[Click here](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/espressif-ide/en/latest/installation.html#esp-idf-and-tools-installation)

3. Install the CP210x driver:

4. Create separate folders for each example

### Testing an example in the Espressif IDE:

1. File > New > Espressif IDF Project
   
2. Name the project according to the example
   
3. Select 'esp32c6' as the target
   
4. Modify or create the files in the base project according to the example folder

5. Press 'Launch' to upload the project to the device

### Important note

The code provided in this repository is intended for educational purposes and is designed to be beginner-friendly. As such, it may lack comprehensive error handling, optimization, and other critical aspects commonly required in production-level software. While the examples aim to demonstrate core concepts and functionality, they may not adhere to best practices for scalability, performance, or reliability in a commercial or industrial environment.
