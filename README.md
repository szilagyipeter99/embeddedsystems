### Testing an example in the Espressif IDE:

1. File > New > Espressif IDF Project
   
2. Name the project according to the example
   
3. Select 'esp32c6' as the target
   
4. Modify or create the files in the base project according to the example folder

5. Press 'Launch' to upload the project to the device
