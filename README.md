# Embedded systems

This repository contains the examples created in the Embedded systems practices. Each folder includes a project with the source code written in the Arduino IDE, tested on the Espressif S3-DevKitC-1U-N8R8.

### Required steps before testing examples:

1. Install the Espressif IDE:
[Click here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)

2. Install the ESP-IDF:

4. Create separate folders for each example

### Testing an example in the Espressif IDE:

1. File > New > Espressif IDF Project
2. Name the project according to the example
3. Select 'esp32c6' as the target
4. Modify or create the files in the base project according to the example folder
5. Press 'Launch'
