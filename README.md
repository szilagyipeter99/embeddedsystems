# Embedded systems

This repository contains the examples created in the Embedded systems practices. Each folder includes a project with the neccessary code written using ESP-IDF, tested on the ESP32-C6-DevKitM-1.

### Required steps before testing examples:

1. Install VS Code:
[Click here](https://code.visualstudio.com)

2. Install ESP-IDF: 
[Click here](https://github.com/szilagyipeter99/embeddedsystems/blob/main/VSCODE_ESP_IDF_SETUP.md)

3. Install the CP210x driver:

### Testing an example:

1. Click the Espressif logo in VS Code and execute the __New Project Wizard__ command

2. Change the default name and path of the project as needed

3. Select __esp32c6__ as the target and __ESP32-C6 chip (via builtin USB-JTAG)__ as the board

4. Choose the __sample-project__ template

5. Modify and add the required files to the project

6. Click the fire icon to execute the __ESP-IDF: Build, Flash and Monitor__ command
