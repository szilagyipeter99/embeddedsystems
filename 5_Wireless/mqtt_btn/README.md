### Recommended folder structure:

Python files can be stored in folders grouped by lecture topics, as organized in this repository. However, for beginners, it is often recommended to place all example code files directly in the root of the project. This way, the project structure is simplified, with only a single folder dedicated to all resources (images, sequences, etc.).

```bash
improc-folder
├── resources-folder
│   ├── resource1.jpg
│   ├── resource2.png
│   └── ...
├── code1.py
├── code2.py
└── ...
```
